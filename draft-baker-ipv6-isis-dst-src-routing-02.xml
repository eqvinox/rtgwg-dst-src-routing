    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification builds on <xref target="RFC5308">IS-IS for
      IPv6</xref> and the critical extension TLV in <xref
      target="critical-subtlvs"/>.  This note defines the sub-TLV for an
      <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6</xref> Source Prefix, to define routes from
      a source prefix to a destination prefix.</t>

      <t>This implements the Destination/Source Routing mechanism described
        in <xref target="dst-src-routing"/>.
      This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but routing "to
      that destination AND from a specified source". It may be combined with
      other qualifying attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination
      AND using a specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix".
      The obvious application is egress routing, as required for a multihomed
      entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several upstream
      networks. Traffic within the network could be source/destination routed
      as well, or could be implicitly or explicitly routed from "any prefix",
      ::/0. Other use cases are described in <xref
      target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>. If a FIB contains
      a route to a given destination from one or more prefixes not including
      ::/0, and a given packet destined there that has a source address that
      is in none of them, the packet in effect has no route, just as if the
      destination itself were not in the route table.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="extensions" title="Theory of Routing">
      <t>Both IS-IS and OSPF perform their calculations by building a lattice
      of routers and links from the router performing the calculation to each
      router, and then use routes (sequences in the lattice) to get to
      destinations that those routes advertise connectivity to. Following the
      SPF algorithm, calculation starts by selecting a starting point
      (typically the router doing the calculation), and successively adding
      {link, router} pairs until one has calculated a route to every router in
      the network. As each router is added, including the original router,
      destinations that it is directly connected to are turned into routes in
      the route table: "to get to 2001:db8::/32, route traffic to {interface,
      list of next hop routers}". For immediate neighbors to the originating
      router, of course, there is no next hop router; traffic is handled
      locally.</t>

      <t>In this context, the route is qualified by a source prefix; It is
      installed into the FIB with the destination prefix, and the FIB applies
      the route if and only if the IPv6 source address also matches the
      advertised prefix. Of course, there may be multiple LSPs in the RIB with
      the same destination and differing source prefixes; these may also have
      the same or differing next hop lists. The intended forwarding action is
      to forward matching traffic to one of the next hop routers associated
      with this destination and source prefix, or to discard non-matching
      traffic as "destination unreachable".</t>

      <t>TLVs that lack a source prefix sub-TLV match any source address
      (i.e., the source prefix TLV defaults to ::/0), by definition.</t>

      <t>When resolving Destination/Source Reachabilities, the SPF calculation
      results used MUST reflect a calculation performed including only routers
      that advertise support for the critical Source Prefix TLV defined in
      section 3.  The mechanism for signaling this is described in <xref
      target="critical-subtlvs"/>.  Routers that support this extension MUST
      advertise support as described there.</t>

      <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

      <section title="Notation">
        <t>For the purposes of this document, a route from the prefix A to the
        prefix B (in other words, whose source prefix is A and whose
        destination prefix is B) is expressed as A-&gt;B. A packet with the
        source address A and the destination address B is similarly described
        as A-&gt;B.</t>
      </section>

      <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

      <section title="Dealing with ambiguity">
        <t>In any routing protocol, there is the possibility of ambiguity. For
        example, one router might advertise a fairly general prefix - a
        default route, a discard prefix (which consumes all traffic that is
        not directed to an instantiated subnet), or simply an aggregated
        prefix while another router advertises a more specific one. In
        source/destination routing, potentially ambiguous cases include cases
        in which the link state database contains two routes A-&gt;B' and
        A'-&gt;B, in which A' is a more specific prefix within the prefix A
        and B' is a more specific prefix within the prefix B. Traditionally,
        we have dealt with ambiguous destination routes using a "longest match
        first" rule. If the same datagram matches more than one destination
        prefix advertised within an area, we follow the route with the longest
        matching prefix.</t>

        <t>With source/destination routes, as noted in <xref
        target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>, we follow a
        similar but slightly different rule; the FIB lookup MUST yield the
        route with the longest matching destination prefix that also matches
        the source prefix constraint. In the event of a tie on the destination
        prefix, it MUST also match the longest matching source prefix among
        those options.</t>

        <t>An example of the issue is this. Suppose we have two routes: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>2001:db8:1::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::/64</t>

            <t>2001:db8:2::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3::/48</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>and a packet <list style="empty">
            <t>2001:db8:2::1 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::1</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If we require the algorithm to follow the longest destination match
        without regard to the source, the destination address matches
        2001:db8:3:3::/64 (the first route), and the source address doesn't
        match the constraint of the first route; we therefore have no route.
        The FIB algorithm, in this example, must therefore match the second
        route, even though it is not the longest destination match, because it
        also matches the source address.</t>
      </section>

      <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

      <section title="Interactions with other constraints">
        <t>In the event that there are other constraints on routing, such as
        proposed in <xref
        target="I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-flowlabel-routing"/>, the effect is a
        logical AND. The FIB lookup must yield the route with the longest
        matching destination prefix that also matches each of the
        constraints.  The general mechanics for this are described in <xref
          target="extra-qualifiers"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multi-topology Routing">
        <t>While not mandatory, IS-IS is often implemented as <xref
        target="RFC5120">Multi Topology Routing</xref> with IPv4 or other
        protocols in the same or different topologies.  The TLV structure in
        <xref target="critical-subtlvs"/> is topology-agnostic in that it
        always includes the topology ID, which may be zero to indicate the
        default topology.</t>

        <t>The mechanism in this document and its Sub-TLV are applicable to
        any topology that carries routing information used for IPv6 Unicast
        routing.  Destination/Source reachability information SHOULD NOT
        be placed differently from "plain" destination reachabilities.</t>

        <t>A system MUST NOT originate Destination/Source Reachabilities in
        a topology that is exclusively configured for multicast RPF operation.
        If a topology is shared between unicast lookups and multicast
        reverse path lookups, reachabilities with a source prefix other than
        ::/0 MUST be ignored for multicast reverse path lookups.</t>

        <t>The statements in the previous two paragraphs currently result in
        applicability of Destination/Source routes as:</t>

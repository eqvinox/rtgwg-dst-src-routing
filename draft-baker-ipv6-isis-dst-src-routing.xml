      traffic from a specified prefix to a specified prefix.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines how to handle <xref
          target="I-D.lamparter-rtgwg-dst-src-routing">destination/source
          routing</xref> information in <xref target="RFC5308">IS-IS for
          IPv6</xref> routing environments.  To this extent, a new sub-TLV for
        an <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6</xref> Source Prefix is added, and 
        <xref target="RFC5120">Multi Topology Routing</xref> is employed to
        address compatibility and isolation concerns.</t>

      <t>The router MUST implement the Destination/Source Routing mechanism
      described in <xref target="I-D.lamparter-rtgwg-dst-src-routing"/>.
      This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but routing "to
      that destination AND from a specified source".
      The obvious application is egress routing, as required for a multihomed
      entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several upstream
      networks. Traffic within the network could be source/destination routed
      as well, or could be implicitly or explicitly routed from "any prefix",
      ::/0. Other use cases are described in <xref
      target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>. If a FIB contains
      a route to a given destination from one or more prefixes not including
      ::/0, and a given packet destined there that has a source address that
      is in none of them, the packet in effect has no route, just as if the
      destination itself were not in the route table.</t>

    <section anchor="routing" title="Theory of Routing">
      <t>Both IS-IS and OSPF perform their calculations by building a lattice
      of routers and links from the router performing the calculation to each
      router, and then use routes (sequences in the lattice) to get to
      destinations that those routes advertise connectivity to. Following the
      SPF algorithm, calculation starts by selecting a starting point
      (typically the router doing the calculation), and successively adding
      {link, router} pairs until one has calculated a route to every router in
      the network. As each router is added, including the original router,
      destinations that it is directly connected to are turned into routes in
      the route table: "to get to 2001:db8::/32, route traffic to {interface,
      list of next hop routers}". For immediate neighbors to the originating
      router, of course, there is no next hop router; traffic is handled
      locally.</t>

      <t>In this context, the route is qualified by a source prefix; It is
      installed into the FIB with the destination prefix, and the FIB applies
      the route if and only if the IPv6 source address also matches the
      advertised prefix. Of course, there may be multiple LSPs in the RIB with
      the same destination and differing source prefixes; these may also have
      the same or differing next hop lists. The intended forwarding action is
      to forward matching traffic to one of the next hop routers associated
      with this destination and source prefix, or to discard non-matching
      traffic as "destination unreachable".</t>

      <t>TLVs that lack a source prefix sub-TLV match any source address
      (i.e., the source prefix TLV defaults to ::/0), by definition.</t>

      <t>To ensure that routers without support for Destination/Source routing
        are excluded from path calculation for routes with a non-default source
        prefix, a separate MTID is used to carry Destination/Source routes.  A
        router MUST NOT participate in a topology with such an MTID unless it
        implements Destination/Source routing.</t>

      <t>There is a distinct Destination/Source Routing MTID for each of the
        underlying base topologies the information applies to.  The set of
        routes propagated towards the forwarding plane is the union of the
        information in the base topology and the D/S Routing MTID.  Incoming
        connectivity information with a default or non-present source prefix
        is advertised in the base topology, routes with non-default source
        prefix are advertised in the D/S Routing MTID.</t>

      <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

      <section title="Notation">
        <t>For the purposes of this document, a route from the prefix A to the
        prefix B (in other words, whose source prefix is A and whose
        destination prefix is B) is expressed as A-&gt;B. A packet with the
        source address A and the destination address B is similarly described
        as A-&gt;B.</t>
      </section>

      <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

      <section title="Dealing with ambiguity">
        <t>In any routing protocol, there is the possibility of ambiguity. For
        example, one router might advertise a fairly general prefix - a
        default route, a discard prefix (which consumes all traffic that is
        not directed to an instantiated subnet), or simply an aggregated
        prefix while another router advertises a more specific one. In
        source/destination routing, potentially ambiguous cases include cases
        in which the link state database contains two routes A-&gt;B' and
        A'-&gt;B, in which A' is a more specific prefix within the prefix A
        and B' is a more specific prefix within the prefix B. Traditionally,
        we have dealt with ambiguous destination routes using a "longest match
        first" rule. If the same datagram matches more than one destination
        prefix advertised within an area, we follow the route with the longest
        matching prefix.</t>

        <t>With source/destination routes, as noted in <xref
        target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>, we follow a
        similar but slightly different rule; the FIB lookup MUST yield the
        route with the longest matching destination prefix that also matches
        the source prefix constraint. In the event of a tie on the destination
        prefix, it MUST also match the longest matching source prefix among
        those options.</t>

        <t>An example of the issue is this. Suppose we have two routes: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>2001:db8:1::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::/64</t>

            <t>2001:db8:2::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3::/48</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>and a packet <list style="empty">
            <t>2001:db8:2::1 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::1</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If we require the algorithm to follow the longest destination match
        without regard to the source, the destination address matches
        2001:db8:3:3::/64 (the first route), and the source address doesn't
        match the constraint of the first route; we therefore have no route.
        The FIB algorithm, in this example, must therefore match the second
        route, even though it is not the longest destination match, because it
        also matches the source address.</t>

      <section title="Multi-topology Routing">
        <t>As outlined in <xref target="routing"/>, this document specifies the
          use of separate topologies for <xref target="RFC5120">Multi Topology
            Routing</xref> to carry Destination/Source routing information.
          These topologies form pairs with a base topology each as follows:</t>
        <figure title="Destination/Source Routing MTIDs">
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

        <t>The rationale for in-/excluding base MTIDs to provide a D/S MTID for
          is as follows:</t>
        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="MTID 0:">The base (non-MTR) topology in some
              installations carries all routing information, including IPv6
              reachabilities.  In such a setup, the topology with MTID TBD-MT0
              is used to carry associated D/S reachabilities.
            </t>
            <t hangText="MTIDs 1 and 3:">Topologies with MTID 1 and 4 carry
              exclusively IPv4 reachabilities.  Thus, no IPv6 D/S topology is
              created to associate with them.</t>
            <t hangText="MTID 2:">The topology with MTID 2 carries IPv6
              reachabilities in common M-ISIS setups.  (MTID 0 in such cases
              carries exclusively IPv4 reachability information.)  Associated
              IPv6 D/S reachabilities MUST be carried in MTID TBD-MT2.</t>
            <t hangText="MTID 4:">MTID 4, while carrying IPv6 connectivity
              information, is used for multicast RPF lookups.  Since
              Destination/Source routing is not compatible with multicast
              RPF lookups, no associated D/S MTID is defined for IS-IS.</t>
            <t hangText="MTID 5:">An alternate management/administration
              topology may carry its routing information in MTID 5.
              Destination/Source routing is applicable to this and MUST use
              MTID TBD-MT5 to carry associated reachability TLVs.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>It should be noted that implementing M-ISIS is thus a prerequirement
          for supporting the protocol outlined in this document.  Even
          installations that previously used only MTID 0 (i.e. no M-ISIS) will
          need to start using MTID TBD-MT0.</t>

             title="Protocol encoding for IPv6 Source Prefix information">
      <t>Destination/Source reachabilities are originated using TLV 237, using

      <t>As noted in <xref target="routing"/>, any IPv6 Reachability TLV that
        does not specify a source prefix is functionally identical to
        specifying ::/0 as the source prefix.  Such routes SHOULD NOT be
        originated into the D/S MTID, but rather into the base MTID.</t>

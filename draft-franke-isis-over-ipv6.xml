    <abstract>
      <t>
         In this draft, a method to transmit IS-IS PDUs as
         IPv6 packets is described. While the default encapsulation of
         IS-IS is specified directly on top of the link-layer, making it
         necessary for IS-IS to be specified for each link-layer it should
         be used on, the proposed method allows for IS-IS to run on any
         link-layers supporting IPv6.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The original specification of IS-IS specifies that PDUs are transmitted
        directly on the link-layer. With this design comes the problem that
        specification work is required each time a new link-layer should be
        supported by IS-IS.
        By transmitting IS-IS PDUs as IPv6 packets, this specification work can
        be avoided and any link-layer supporting IPv6 can be used.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification does not make changes to the general operation of
        IS-IS and any existing mechanisms should be kept as-is. The only change
        made by this draft is the format of IS-IS PDUs on the wire.

    <section title="Transmitting IS-IS PDUs over IPv6">
      <section title="Addressing">
        <t>
          Link-local IPv6 addresses are used to transmit and receive IS-IS PDUs.
          Routers should set the source address of transmitted the PDUs to the
          link-local address of the outgoing interface.
        </t>
        <t>
          IPv6 link-local multicast is used as destination for the packets. The PDUs
          that would be sent to ALL-L1-IS when sending them directly on top of the
          link-layer MUST be sent to the IPv6 multicast group &lt;TBD&gt; instead.

          Respectively, PDUs that would be sent to ALL-L2-IS MUST be sent to the multicast
          group &lt;TBD&gt;.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="IPv6 header">
        <t>
          The packets SHOULD be transmitted with type of service set to Internetwork control.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Packet format">
        <t>
          To transmit IS-IS PDUs over IPv6, they are encapsulated as IPv6
          payload without any transport layer protocol. For that purpose,
          protocol number 124 is used. That number was assigned by IANA for
          IS-IS over IPv4. <xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-wg-over-ip-02" />
          The PDUs are transmitted as IPv6 payload starting at the NLPI.
        </t>

    <section title="Considerations for using IS-IS over IPv6">
      <section title="SNPA">
        <t>
          Using the ethernet MAC address as SNPA is not practical for this application since
          the goal of this document is to become independent from specific link-layer properties.
        </t>
        <t>
          While the IS-IS over IPv4 draft constructs the SNPA by padding the IPv4 address, we are
          facing the issue that an IPv6 address will not fit into a standard sized SNPA.
        </t>
        <t>
          Currently, we convert the 64-bit interface identifier of the IPv6 link-local
          address of nodes back to an EUI48 format by using bytes 8 through 10 and bytes
          13 through 15 of a nodes IPv6 address and flipping bit 0x02 in the first byte.
        </t>
        <t>
          This is not an ideal solution and better proposals will be happily considered.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="MTU">
        <t>All transmitted IPv6 packets should have a maximum size of 1280 bytes. This allows for
           the protocol to run on any link supporting IPv6. Fragmentation should not be used, therefore
           the lsp-mtu may have to be adjusted for the LSPs to fit into 1280 byte packets.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)

                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
